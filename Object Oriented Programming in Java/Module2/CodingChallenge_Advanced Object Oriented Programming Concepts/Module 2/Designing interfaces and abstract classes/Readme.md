# Abstract Classes and Interfaces Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the Abstract Classes and Interfaces Challenge! This exercise will help you understand and implement key concepts of object-oriented programming in Java:
- Abstract methods and abstract classes
- Interfaces and their implementation
- Polymorphism with abstract types
- Multiple interface inheritance

In this challenge, you'll create a system for various musical instruments that demonstrates how to use abstract classes and interfaces to model real-world relationships and behaviors. You'll see how these concepts enable code reuse, polymorphism, and proper organization of code.

## What You'll Learn
By completing this challenge, you'll gain hands-on experience with:
1. Creating and implementing abstract methods
2. Defining abstract classes and extending them
3. Creating interfaces and implementing them
4. Using polymorphism to work with different objects through common interfaces
5. Understanding the difference between abstract classes and interfaces
6. Implementing multiple interfaces to achieve a form of multiple inheritance
