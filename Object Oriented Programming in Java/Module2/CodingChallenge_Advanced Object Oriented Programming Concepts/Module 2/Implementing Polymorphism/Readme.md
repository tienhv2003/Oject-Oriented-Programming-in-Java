# Introduction
This challenge will help you practice and understand the concept of polymorphism in Java - one of the four fundamental OOP principles. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with methods being called based on the actual object type rather than the reference type.
In this challenge, you'll build a Shape Hierarchy System by creating a Shape superclass and various shape subclasses that inherit from it. This will demonstrate how polymorphism enables flexible and extensible code design.

## What You'll Learn
- How to create a superclass with common methods
- How to create subclasses that inherit from the superclass
- How to override methods in subclasses
- How to use polymorphism to create instances of different shapes
- How to store subclass objects in an array of the superclass type

## The Challenge
You'll create several Java classes:
1. Shape.java - The superclass with common methods
2. Circle.java, Rectangle.java, Triangle.java - Subclasses that extend Shape
3. ShapeDemo.java - A client program that demonstrates polymorphism
