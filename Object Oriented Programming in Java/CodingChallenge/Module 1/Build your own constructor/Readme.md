# Employee Management System Challenge

## What is this challenge?
This is a Java coding challenge where you'll build a simple Employee Management System from scratch. You'll create a program that can store employee information, validate data, perform calculations like determining annual salary, and even make copies of employee records.

## What will you do?
In this challenge, you'll:
1. Create a basic Employee class to store information like name, age, and salary
2. Add different ways to create new employees (using different constructors)
3. Make your code secure by hiding data and adding validation rules
4. Implement useful features like calculating annual salary and giving raises
5. Learn how to make copies of employee objects when needed
6. Test everything to make sure it works properly

## What will you learn?
Through this hands-on exercise, you'll learn:
- Encapsulation: How to protect data by making it private and only accessible through controlled methods
- Constructor overloading: How to create multiple ways to initialize objects
- Data validation: How to ensure information like age and salary follows business rules
- Object cloning: How to make copies of objects when needed
- Java fundamentals: Working with classes, methods, interfaces, and exception handling
