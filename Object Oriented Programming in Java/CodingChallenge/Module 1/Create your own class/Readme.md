# Java Student Class Challenge 

## Introduction
Welcome to the Java Student Class Challenge! In this hands-on exercise, you'll create your first Java class from scratch and learn fundamental object-oriented programming concepts.

## What You'll Build
You'll develop a complete student record management system with two classes:
- A Student class to store and manage individual student information
- A StudentRegistry class to demonstrate how to use your Student class in a real application

## What You'll Learn
Through this challenge, you'll master essential Java programming skills:
1. Class Design: Creating classes with appropriate attributes and methods
2. Encapsulation: Using private variables with getter/setter methods
3. Data Validation: Implementing simple validation in setter methods
4. Method Creation: Building utility methods for displaying data and calculations
5. Object Instantiation: Creating and working with multiple objects
6. Object Comparison: Comparing properties between different instances

## How the Challenge Works
The provided skeleton-challenge.java file contains the structure with detailed comments guiding you through each step. You'll implement:
- Private instance variables for student data (ID, name, grade, active status)
- Accessor methods (getters and setters) with validation
- Utility methods like grade calculation and student comparison
- A main program that demonstrates your class in action

After completing the challenge, you can compare your work with the provided solution in `solutions` directory.
