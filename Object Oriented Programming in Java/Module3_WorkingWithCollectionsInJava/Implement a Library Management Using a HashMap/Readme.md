# The Challenge: Library Management System

## Introduction
In this challenge, you'll apply your knowledge of HashMaps to create a simple Library Management System. This project will reinforce your understanding of key Java collection concepts while building a practical application.

#### By completing this challenge, you'll practice:
- Using HashMap as a collection to store book information
- Adding new books to your library collection
- Searching for books by various attributes
- Removing books from the collection
- Viewing your library catalog in sorted order

This exercise builds on the concepts from the Phonebook lab but with a different real-world application to strengthen your skills.

Your task is to build a system that manages a library's book collection. Each book will have attributes like 
- title
- author
- genre
- publication year

Users should be able to add books, search by title or author, check out books (removing them from the collection), and view the entire catalog sorted by title or author.
