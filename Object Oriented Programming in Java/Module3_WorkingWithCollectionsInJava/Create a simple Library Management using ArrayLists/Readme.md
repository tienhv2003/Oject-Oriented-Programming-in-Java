# Create a simple Library Management using ArrayLists
## Introduction
In this challenge, you'll create a Library Management System using Java ArrayLists. This project will help you practice essential ArrayList operations while building a practical application. 

#### You'll develop a system that allows users to:
- Add books to a library collection
- View all books in the collection
- Search for books by title or author
- Check out and return books
- Sort books by different criteria
- Filter books based on availability

#### This challenge reinforces the key concepts covered in the lab about ArrayLists:
- Creating and working with ArrayLists
- Adding and removing elements
- Manipulating objects in ArrayLists
- Sorting ArrayList elements
- Filtering ArrayList data
